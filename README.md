# ALL OF US ARE AMUSED

(a console-based game inspired by All of Us Are Dead)

The objective of this game is to primarily fulfill the
requirements of Output 1 for the Fundamentals of Data
Structures and Algorithm lecture. Specifically, this game displays
a map of a zombie-infested amusement park where the player
must go to the best route to solve the mystery of the zombie
apocalypse. Moreover, the program stores and suggests
accurate calculations for the distance and shortest path
among the rides. All in all, the proponents resorted to this
fictional map concept to creatively showcase the
implementation of 1D array for data storage and stimulate the
players with the game's mystery.
